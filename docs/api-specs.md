# API Specifications

Source of truth is the OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas in `/packages/schemas`.

- REST (OpenAPI): endpoints, request/response models
- GraphQL (SDL): types, queries, mutations, subscriptions
- WebSocket events (Socket.IO): namespaces, rooms, payloads

CI will regenerate this file from schemas and fail PRs if out-of-sync.

Status: Placeholder. Populate once schemas are added.
