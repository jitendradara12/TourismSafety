# Data Models & ERD

Primary datastore: PostgreSQL + PostGIS + Timescale.

- Tables, columns, indices
- Views/materialized views
- Retention policies
- Migration notes

This file should be generated from migrations (e.g., Prisma/TypeORM) in CI.

Status: Placeholder. Update with the initial ERD in Sprint 1.
